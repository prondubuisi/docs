If it’s your first time using Fly.io, you’ll need to sign up for an account. To sign up, run:

```cmd
fly auth signup
```

This will take you to the sign-up page where you can sign up in one of the following ways:

* **Sign up with email**: Enter your name, email and password.

* **Sign up with Google**: Use your Google account to sign in to Fly.io.

* **Sign up with GitHub**: Use your GitHub to sign in to Fly.io. Look out for the confirmation email we'll send you, which will give you a link to set a password; you'll need a password set so we can actively verify that it is you for some Fly.io operations.

**Note:** At some point, you'll be prompted for credit card payment information. New accounts start on our Pay As You Go plan. See [Pricing](/docs/about/pricing) and [Billing](/docs/about/billing/) for more details.
</div>

Whichever route you take you'll be signed up, signed in, and returned to your command line, ready to use Fly.io.
